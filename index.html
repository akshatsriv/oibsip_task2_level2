			<p>Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who is credited with originating the concept of a programmable computer. Considered by some to be a "father of the computer", Babbage is credited with designing the first mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
			<p>He was born on December 26, 1791, in London, England. Babbage was a self-taught mathematician and invented many machines throughout his life. Although none of his machines were completed in his lifetime, his ideas and designs laid the foundation for modern computing.</p>
			<p>Babbage died on October 18, 1871, in London, England, and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.</p>
